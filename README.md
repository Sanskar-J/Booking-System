# Project Photography Booking System

This repository contains a Visual Studio .NET Windows Form project written in C# that implements a Photography Booking System. The system allows users to book photography sessions and manage the bookings efficiently. The project has two branches, `v1` and `v2`, each connected to a different database.

## Branches

### v1

The `v1` branch contains the application connected to a MySQL database. This version of the project utilizes MySQL as the underlying database management system. Users can interact with the application to book photography sessions, view existing bookings, and perform various management operations.

### v2

The `v2` branch contains the application connected to a MongoDB Atlas object-relational database. This version of the project utilizes MongoDB as the database technology. Users can utilize the application to book photography sessions, view existing bookings, and perform management tasks. The integration with MongoDB Atlas offers increased scalability and flexibility.

## Features

The Photography Booking System project offers the following features:

- User-friendly Windows Form interface for intuitive interaction.
- Booking functionality to allow users to schedule photography sessions.
- View and manage existing bookings.
- Integration with either MySQL or MongoDB Atlas databases, depending on the branch.
- Database connectivity for efficient storage and retrieval of data.
- Scalability and flexibility, particularly with MongoDB Atlas integration in `v2` branch.
